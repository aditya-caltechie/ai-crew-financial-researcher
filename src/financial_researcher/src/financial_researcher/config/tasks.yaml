# Task Configuration - Step 2 of Implementation Guide
#
# Define work items that agents will execute. Each task needs:
# - description: What needs to be done (be specific and detailed)
# - expected_output: What "done" looks like
# - agent: Which agent performs this task (must match agent name from agents.yaml)
# - context (optional): List of task names whose outputs should be used as input
# - output_file (optional): Where to save the result
#
# Tasks with 'context' will run after their dependencies in sequential process.
# Use placeholders like {company} that will be filled from inputs in main.py
